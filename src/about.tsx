    From the earliest times in history, mankind has looked to expand.  We have sought to explore and thrive.  From the old earth Abrahamic religions, we were told to "go forth, and multiply."  This was the task given to Noah in the days after the dove returned with signs of land.   Go forth, and Multiply.
    <br /><br />
    But, it wasn't a dove, over the years, the translation was lost, in the original story, it was a raven.
    <br /><br />
    Now, thousands of years later, Raven Colonial Corporation, wishes to continue that millenias old command.
    <br /><br />
    Go forth, and Multiply.
